#### Running MicroBlocks in the Browser ####

You can run MicroBlocks in the Chrome or Edge browser.
Running MicroBlocks in the browser avoids the need to install a conventional application,
a process that often requires IT assistance.

To run MicroBlocks in the brower, open [https://microblocks.fun](https://microblocks.fun)
and click **Run** in the navigation bar at the top of the screen. That's it!

#### Saving the MicroBlocks Web App ####

MicroBlocks is a "progressive web app", which means you can make a local copy
that you can launch via a shortcut icon like a conventional application.
Once saved, the MicroBlocks web app even runs offline!

To save the MicroBlocks web app, run MicroBlocks in your browser, then click the small web app
**install** button on the top right of the browser's URL bar:

Chrome:<br>

Edge:<br>
<img src="/assets/img/md/get-started/pwainstall-edge.png" width="200">

That will install the web app and open MicroBlocks in a new window.
It will also add a shortcut icon to your desktop so you can launch the web app later.
