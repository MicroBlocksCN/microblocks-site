#### Running MicroBlocks in the Browser ####

You can run MicroBlocks a Chrome or Edge browser on a Chromebook, laptop, or desktop computer.
Running MicroBlocks in the browser avoids the need to install a conventional application,
a process that often requires IT assistance in school settings.

To run MicroBlocks in the brower, open [https://microblocks.fun](https://microblocks.fun)
and click "Run" in the navigation bar at the top of the screen. That's it!

#### Saving the MicroBlocks Web App ####

MicroBlocks is a "progressive web app", which means you can save a local copy
of it that you can launch via a shortcut icon like a conventional application.
Once saved, the web app even runs offline!

To save the MicroBlocks web app, click the "install" button on the top right of the
microblocks website navigation bar. That will open MicroBlocks in a new window.
It will also add a shortcut icon to your desktop so you can launch the web app later.
