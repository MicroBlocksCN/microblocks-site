The yellow LED will flicker as the firmware is installed. It takes a few seconds.

If you are running the MicroBlocks app, MicroBlocks will connect to the board automatically
when it is done.

**Extra Steps in Browser**

If you are running MicroBlocks in the browser or as a web app, you need to help the browser.
(For security reasons, the browser cannot access the board's USB drive without asking the user.)

First, select your board type from the menu.

You'll be asked to select the USB drive for the board in the browser's file save dialog.

Follow the instructions to save the firmware file on your board.

The yellow light will flicker, stop, then flicker again briefly as the board re-connects
itself as a USB drive. Wait until that entire sequence is complete—about ten seconds—then
click the USB icon to connect to the board.
