If they don't turn green the first time, try again.

Firmware installation takes just a few seconds.
If you are running the MicroBlocks app, MicroBlocks will connect to the board automatically
when it is done.

**Extra Steps in Browser**

If you are running MicroBlocks in the browser or as a web app, you need to help the browser.
For security reasons, the browser cannot access the board's USB drive without asking the user.

First, select your board type from the menu.

They you'll be asked to select the USB drive for the board in the browser's file save dialog.

except that the reset button is on the back of the board.

below the USB connector.)
