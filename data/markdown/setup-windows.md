#### Windows Setup ####

Go to the [Download](/download) page and click the **Download** button.

If you are running Chrome or Edge you will be warned that the downloaded file could harm you computer.
You will need to click "keep" or "keep anyway" several times. (Firefox does not present those
warning dialogs; you can just save or run the installer.)

Open the saved file, **microBlocks setup.exe**. That will open the installer.
Click through the installer screens to install the app. The installer will launch
MicroBlocks when it is done. It also adds a shortcut icon to the Desktop
that you can use to run MicroBlocks later.

Once the MicroBlocks app is open, you can proceed to **Setting up your board**.
