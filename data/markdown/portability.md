**Run Everywhere**

MicroBlocks runs on many different boards, but your scripts are portable. Buttons, sensors, and display blocks behave the same on all boards with the relevant hardware. MicroBlocks even simulates the micro:bit 5x5 LED display on TFT displays.

**Plug in to share**

With MicroBlocks, the board acts like a memory stick. No need for files; just plug in a board and the scripts reappear. Hand your board to a friend so they can explore your code. They might even add a cool new feature!
