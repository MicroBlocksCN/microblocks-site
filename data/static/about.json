Before that, he worked in Dr. Alan Kay's research group, first at Apple Computer, then at Walt Disney Imagineering, where he helped create the Squeak portable Smalltalk system and Etoys, a programming system for children that was one of the inspirations for Scratch. After leaving the Scratch team in 2013, John led the creation of GP Blocks, a blocks language aimed at older students and adults, and MicroBlocks. John got his Ph.D. in Computer Science from the University of Washington. In his free time, John plays the dulcian, the Renaissance ancestor of the modern bassoon. At MicroBlocks, he is the lead developer for both the VM and the standalone IDE, as well as a member of the Project Leadership Committee and the project representative.",

Earlier at Mozilla, she championed a grant for MicroBlocks to include a \"Web Things\" library, so that any script could easily become an interoperable web thing, a standard for IoT devices. She has experience bridging open communities with industry to drive faster innovation. She is super keen on equity of access to a good (STEM) education, across the globe, which is part of what drives her strong desire to support MicroBlocks. Prior to Mozilla, she held senior roles at Arduino.org, Qualcomm Atheros, and many more. She received her bachelor's degree in Electrical Engineering from the University of Minnesota, and her master's in EE from Stanford. When not at a computer, she can usually be found exploring the great outdoors of northern California. At MicroBlocks, she directs global partnerships and outreach, and is part of the Project Leadership Committee.",
